This is the source code that accompanies the Apress book, 
Pro Android Web Apps (http://apress.com/book/view/1430232765), written by
Damon Oehlman (http://twitter.com/DamonOehlman) and SÃ©bastien Blanc (http://twitter.com/sebi2706).

As this is a book on mobile web applications, the source code is 
primarily comprised of HTML, CSS and Javascript.  

Each of the chapters code samples are stored in the snippets directory, 
except in the cases where the sample code for that directory formed part of 
a larger exercise.  In these cases that chapter points to the location of the
source so it can be referenced easily.

While every attempt has been made to make sure this code is bug free, if anything
has slipped through the cracks please let us know at the Apress Site:

And possibly also submit an issue in the Github Issue Tracker:

Thanks for your interest in the book :)
